This is the AGAMA library for galaxy modelling.

Its main tasks include:

  - Computation of gravitational potential and forces;
  - Orbit integration and analysis;
  - Conversion between position/velocity and action/angle coordinates;
  - Distribution functions;
  - Self-consistent multi-component galaxy models;
  - Framework for dealing with observational data and selection functions;
  - Framework for finding best-fit parameters of a model from data;
  - Auxiliary utilities (e.g., various mathematical routines).

The core of the library is written in C++, and there are Python and Fortran interfaces.
It comes with a collection of examples and test programs both in C++ and Python.

A detailed documentation for the AGAMA library is presented in a separate file docs/readme.pdf,
and more technical description may be extracted from source files with Doxygen.
Instructions for compilation are in the file INSTALL.
