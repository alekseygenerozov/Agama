    \brief   Estimation of interfocal distance for Staeckel fudge action/angle finder
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev
    \date    2015

    Routines in this file estimate the "interfocal distance" - the parameter of auxiliary
    prolate spheroidal coordinate system that is used in the Staeckel fudge approximation.
    There are two methods:
    The first one finds the best suitable interfocal distance by fitting a regression 
    (eq.9 in Sanders 2012) for the potential derivatives computed at the given array 
    of points in R-z plane (which should normally belong to the same orbit).
    The second method computes the best-fit parameter of the coordinate system in which
    a shell orbit in R-z plane (the one with zero radial action) follows the coordinate line 
    lambda=const as closely as possible. This method is much more computationally expensive,
    so to speed up the computations, one should instead use an interpolator that returns 
    the value of interfocal distance from a precomputed grid in (E,L_z) space.
    This interpolator is created and used internally in actions::ActionFinderAxisymFudge class.

/** Estimate the interfocal distance by locating a thin (shell) orbit in R-z plane 
    for the given values of energy and angular momentum, 
    and finding the parameters of prolate spheroidal coordinate system in which 
    the trajectory is as close to  lambda=const  as possible.
    Note that the procedure is rather computationally expensive (requires many more 
    potential evaluations than computing the actions and angles themselves);
    thus it is more efficient to create an instance of `InterfocalDistanceFinder` 
    that pre-computes this quantity on a grid in E,Lz space, and uses interpolation
    to find the suitable value for any position/velocity point.

    \param[in] poten  is the instance of axisymmetric potential;
    \param[in] E is the total energy of the orbit;
    \param[in] Lz is the angular momentum of the orbit;
    \param[out] R (optional) - if not NULL, will store the cylindrical radius at which 
    the shell orbit crosses the equatorial plane;
    \return  the best-fit value of interfocal distance for this shell orbit.
