/** Description of function behavior near a given point: the value and two derivatives,
    and the estimates of nearest points where the function takes on 
    strictly positive or negative values, or crosses zero.

    These estimates may be used to safely determine the interval of locating a root or minimum: 
    for instance, if one knows that f(x_1)=0 or very nearly zero (to within roundoff errors), 
    f(x_neg) is strictly negative,  and f(x) is positive at some interval between x_1 and x_neg,
    then one needs to find x_pos close to x_1 such that the root is strictly bracketed between 
    x_pos and x_neg (i.e. f(x_pos)>0). This is exactly the task for this little helper class.
    Another application is to post-process the result obtained by a root-finding routine,
    which ensures only that f(x_root) is approximately zero, but does not guarantee is sign,
    or even its magnitude (it only ensures that the root is located to a certain accuracy).
    If we need a point close to x_root with a known sign of f(x), this class can do the job.

    Note that the function is only computed at the given point (or, if its implementation 
    does not provide derivatives itself, they are computed numerically using one or two 
    nearby points);  thus the estimates provided by this utility class are only valid 
    as long as f(x0) is close to zero, or, more precisely, if the offsets ~|f/f'| are 
    much smaller than the scale of function variation ~|f'/f''|.
